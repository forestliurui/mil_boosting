preprocess LETOR dataset, originally stored in three different files: train.txt, test.txt and vali.txt

merge them into one csv files and only store those queries whose number of associated docs is greater than a threshold (e.g 500)

Format conversion:
each row in train/test/vali.txt file: (like feature_id:feature_value)
score qid:131 1:3 2:1 ...

into

each row in csv: (remove feature_id)
score, qid:131,3,1,...
